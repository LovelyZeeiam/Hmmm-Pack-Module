#> hmmm:bitwise/float/32/compare/equal/main
#   Checks for equality between two floating point numbers
##
# @params
#   io.P[0, 1, 2]
#       32-bit sign, 32-bit exponent, 32-bit significand
#   io.P[3, 4, 5]
#       32-bit sign, 32-bit exponent, 32-bit significand
# @returns
#   io.R0
#       0 if numbers are not equal, 1 if they are.
